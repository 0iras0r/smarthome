## skalavala's Home Automation/Smart Home

Here you will find a bunch of scripts that I use to automate my home.

I have a bunch of Raspberry Pi's, and Pi Zeros at home along with a bunch of "smart" devices of various brands. All these smart devices work great independently but not together. My goal is to bring all of them together and have them talk to each other with a little bit of programming and make them really smarter as a whole! I also want to be able to run all the software on Raspberry Pi's only.

The primary Home Automation software/platform that I use is [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io/) (HA). It is an open-source home automation platform written by a bunch of smart individuals. HA allows you to track and control devices easily with simple configuration and with a little bit of scripting, you can do wonders. It is also a perfect piece of software to run entirely on a single Raspberry Pi.

The following picture shows high level architecture of my home network, and what I use for basic automation stuff.

Please feel free to let me know if you find any issues with my code, and/or have any suggestions. Thank you!
